# Dear all,

for preparing the whole study for Crowdee, all the html files must be merged into one by using the carousel-items (the example is attached). Therefore, we need to give unique item names for each item input (except for those, where you have multiple answer options, but only single choice questions – the multiple inputs need to have the same unique name).

General note: In the example html: please copy all style information for the different html files if they differ into the style section under the <head> command! 

## Group 1 

will take over the merging of the WTP and WTA questions with the unique naming convention of inputs: gr1_q1, gr1_q2, gr1_q3…..
### Please create: 
-	1html file for your longer WTP part and WTA part
-	1html file for the shorter WTP part (same WTA part as for 1. html file) 

### Attention: 
-	The WTP and WTA questions have the option “I don’t want to pay for the protection of data” (WTP), or “I don’t want to sell data“ (WTA). Therefore, we discussed to have the same unique name for the “I don`t want to” input and the previous slider option! 
-	The “next page” button must be changed for all carousel-items to:	"<input type="button" value="Nächste Seite" style="float: right;" data-bs-target="#carouselControls" data-bs-slide="next"/> "


## Group 2

Will take care of the 1_Teilnehmerinformationen, 2_Code Nutzung, 5_Privacy_Behaviour, and 6_Privacy_Efficiacy with the unique naming convention of inputs: gr2_q1, gr2_2, gr2_3….
### Please create:
-	1 html file where the 1_Teilnehmerinformationen and 2_Code Nutzung are combined with unique names for each input 
-	1 html file where the 5_Privacy_Behaviour, and 6_Privacy_Efficacy are combined with unique names for each input 
### Attention: 
-	For all single choice questions (all likert scale questions!) you need to have the same unique name for all answer options! 
-	The “next page” button must be changed for all carousel-items to: <input type="button" value="Nächste Seite" style="float: right;" data-bs-target="#carouselControls" data-bs-slide="next" /> 

## Group 3

Will take care of 3_5 Privacy Knowledge, 3_6_Pricacy_Concern and 3_7_Demographics with the unique naming convention of inputs: gr3_q1, gr3_2, gr3_3….
### Please create:
-	1 html file with the privacy knowledge questions 3_5 Privacy Knowledge – with unique input names (according to your naming convention) 
-	1 html file for the 3_6_Privacy_Concern questionnaire and 3_7_Demographics merged with carousel-items 
### Attention: 
-	For all single choice questions (e.g. all likert scale questions!) you need to have the same unique name for all answer options! 
-	The “next page” button must be changed for all carousel-items to: <input type="button" value="Nächste Seite" style="float: right;" data-bs-target="#carouselControls" data-bs-slide="next" /> 

## Group 4

Will take care of 4_3 Privacy Awarness Before, 4_4 Nudges and 4_5 Privacy Awareness After with the unique naming convention of inputs: gr4_q1, gr4_2, gr4_3….

### Please create:
-	1 html file with 4_3 Privacy Awarness Before, 4_4 Nudges and 4_5 Privacy Awareness After merged with the carousel items for the control group
-	1 html file with 4_3 Privacy Awarness Before, 4_4 Nudges and 4_5 Privacy Awareness After merged with the carousel items for the experimental group
### Attention: 
-	For all single choice questions (e.g. all likert scale questions!) you need to have the same unique name for all answer options! 
-	The “next page” button must be changed for all carousel-items to: <input type="button" value="Nächste Seite" style="float: right;" data-bs-target="#carouselControls" data-bs-slide="next" />
